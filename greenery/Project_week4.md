### Question 3
<p>
My organization uses dbt cloud, however I don't get a chance to use it much. One thing i would recommend is the organization this class has taught me, or at least to be consistent. I think that might be a product of multiple people ramping up on dbt and not having a clear direction and it's kind of hard to go back at this point. 

I don't know if i'll move to analytics engineering, but I like the idea of not being blocked by other teams because they don't have to time to help...so in that case I've picked up skills where hopefully I can do more in dbt to move things along without being reliant on our data/analytics engg team at times. 

3b. I would set up the jobs to run early morning EST say 5am that way the India team or I could notice if any jobs fail early before the majority of the company on the West Coast logs in. Would orchestrate it using Airflow as that's what we use in conjunction with dbt cloud. </p>
