### Question 1
<p> I created a table already called fct_page_views which ties events and product data together. From here you can write the code to get conversion rate overall which was 62.5%. In theory if the data was right, products is there and you would just add product_name to the select statement and group by it to get at the product level.</p>
<br>

### Question 2
<p> Created a model called fct_product_order_quantity_agg that leverages the product_name macro to created new columns that sum the quantity by product</p>
<br>

### Question 3
<p> I was able to run this </p>
<br>

### Question 4
<p> I was able to install dbt-utils
</p>
<br>

### Question 5
<p> Added the DAG picture to project </p>
<br>

### Question 6
<p> Pothos, Monstera, Philodendron, String of Pearls, Bamboo, ZZ Plant
</p>
